# AHDMIL: Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning for Fast and Accurate Whole-Slide Image Classiffcation
![Model Architecture](Framework.png)

This repository is an **extended version** of our previous conference paper published at [CVPR 2025](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Dong_Fast_and_Accurate_Gigapixel_Pathological_Image_Classification_with_Hierarchical_Distillation_CVPR_2025_paper.html).  
The current version includes additional experiments, a redesigned architecture, and deeper analysis.  
If you previously used the CVPR version, we highly encourage switching to this updated version.

## Training & Validation & Testing

### Step1: Self-Distillation (SD)

### Step2: Asymmetric Distillation (AD)
